# torbie
Simulate values from probability distributions
### What is it?
torbie is the name of a R package created to simulate values from three probability distributions: Normal, Poisson and Binomial. 
It is also the name of a type of cat coat coloring. A torbie is a Tortoiseshell cat with the tabby pattern, also known as *lapjeskat* in Dutch. 
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortoiseshell_cat) Tortoiseshell cats combine two colours other than white, either closely mixed or in larger patches.

### Installation
The fastest way to install the package would be to use *devtools::install_github*. 
Alternatively you could clone the repository and build the package via RStudio.

### Next steps
* Adapt code for other distributions
  + Get list of distributions in *stats*
  + Use some non-standard evaluation to dynamically get random generation function
* Think of a more relevant name than torbie
